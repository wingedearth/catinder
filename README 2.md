# CaTinder

> It's a fight; which *cat*-ender will win!?

Tonight we will use our knowledge of the Rails web application framework
to build a "feature subset" of everyone's favorite new start-up: 
[Grindr](http://grindr.com). But with cats!

***Wait, I meant [Tinder](http://www.gotinder.com)!!!***

## Setup

**Work outside of the class repo!**

Create a new Rails app named `catinder`. 
**[Use the class's Rails Starter guide.](/resources/cheatsheets/rails_starter.md)**

**Please finish through Part One at least.** Try to get through 
**Part Three**, but if you find yourself stuck, you can instead work on
the Bootstrap Hogwarts exercise.

As always: more is better; healthy living is best. Only do the bonus if 
you have completed every single part.

### Part 0: Create a Root Route

#### Root Route (`GET /`)

Build a welcome page for the website, and make it visit the controller
and action `welcome#index`. You can do this simply in `/config/routes.rb`,
in fact, the example is in the comments code that comes in the file!

```ruby
root "welcome#index"
```

This page should say:

```
Welcome to CaTinder!

Who is Meow, and who is Not-Meow? You decide!

Click Here to Get Started
```

By clicking on the *link* on the page, you go to `/cats?random=true`.
This will give us an error, since we haven't implemented it, but that's
just fine!

#### Integrate Bootstrap

Install Bootstrap on your app. 
**[Use the class's Bootstrap guide.](/resources/cheatsheets/bootstrap_cheatsheet.md)**

Now, make sure that your app has a [menu/nav bar][nav], a large logo,
and the above text. Finally, add some images of cats. You can model 
it off of the [current Tinder homepage](https://www.gotinder.com).

**Note:**

- There are assets available in the `/assets` folder here, including
  a logo and some images.

<!-- - The above example is using the font **Lato 300** from Google Fonts. -->

### Part 1: Generate the Application's Model

Implement the following ERD with an ActiveRecord migration and model.

![CaTinder ERD](assets/catinder-erd.png)

This application uses straightforward, single, CRUD logic. There is a
seed file that comes bundled with this README: **[`seeds.rb`](seeds.rb)**
that you can run to put some cats in the database.

### Part 2: Cat Read Routes (INDEX & SHOW)

#### Cat List, aka Index Cats (`GET /cats`)

A list of the cats! Show the picture and number of votes for every cat 
in the database!

#### Cat Page, aka Show Cat (`GET /cats/:id`)

This will show a single cat from the database. The param `:id` is the 
cat's id. Make sure to show the image and the number of votes.

### Part 3: Adding Custom Logic (`GET /cats?random=true`)

Now, when we go to the cats index route (`GET /cats`) with the param 
`random`, redirect to a random cat show page (`GET /cats/:id`). If you
want to know how to redirect, check either an example "scaffold" of a 
resource, or [our class's example Rails repo][example].

Next, on every cat's show page (`GET /cats/:id`), make sure there is a 
link to `GET /cats?random=true` with the title "**Next Cat**".

### Part 4: Cat Create Routes (NEW & CREATE)

#### Cat Form, aka New Cats (`GET /cats/new`)

Use a `form_for` helper to build a standard cat creation form.

#### Cat Addition, aka Create Cats (`POST /cats`)

Implement strong parameters (ie, whitelisting) and a `cats#create`
action that will add a new cat and redirect to its show page!

---

### Part 5: Vote! (`PUT /cats/:id`)

Add the update action to our application (`cats#update`)!

Add a button to the cat's show page (`GET /cats/:id`) that goes to that
cats' update route with the param `vote=true`. When we do this, two
things happen:

1. this cat is up-voted in the database, and
1. we redirect to another random cat with `GET /cats?random=true`

## Bonus: HTML &amp; Styling

Make your page look like Tinder's! Example:

<img alt="Meeeoooow! An example of the Tinder interface." src="assets/tinder-large-example.png" height="250" />   
<caption>Click on the above to see a larger example.</caption>

You can find the symbols used above [right there in Bootstrap][glyphs]!
